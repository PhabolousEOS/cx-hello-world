 Repository with Tlale

Hi Tlale!

Phoebe here. Have you setup your Github account? I need to download and familiarize myself with VS code. 
I just love coding! Don't you? Sometimes we get stuck but we NEVER give up. Let's learn how to use this platform well.
Paired with Consistency, studying programming languages a little each day and a POSITIVE MINDSET NOTHING can stop us.

On Github we will  learn how to 
1. Create and use a repository
2. Start and manage a new branch
3. Make changes to a file and push them to GitHub as commits
4. Open and merge a pull request
5. make mention of one another for example (@tlale)

We should read the Github flow guide found at the end of the introduction
We might also collectively find an open source project through Github explore
Let's practice collaborating together on here.


While we are learning to collaborate on here let's choose a free prep course to take together.
I have briefly looked at Kenzie.free. What prep course have you started on? Let's find our consistency. 
How far are you with the Grasshopper app?
So those are my thoughts thus far.
