 Repository with Tlale

Hi Tlale

Phoebe here. Have you setup your Github account? I need to download and familiarize myself with VS code. 
I just love coding! Sometimes we get stuck but we NEVER give up. Let's learn how to use this platform well.
Paired with Consistency, other programming languages and a postitive mindset NOTHING can stop us.

 On Github we will be Creating repositories, creating branches, making commits, opening pull requests, making mention of one another (@tlale) and merging pull requests.
Let's practice collaborating together on here.
