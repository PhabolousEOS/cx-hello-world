 Repository with Tlale

Hi Tlale

Phoebe here. Have you setup your Github account? I need to download and familiarize myself with VS code. 
I just love coding! Sometimes we get stuck but we NEVER give up. Let's learn how to use this platform well.
Paired with Consistency, studying programming languages a little each day and a postitive mindset NOTHING can stop us.

 On Github we will be Creating repositories, creating branches, making commits, opening pull requests, making mention of one another (@tlale) and merging pull requests.
Let's practice collaborating together on here.

While we are learning to collaborate on here let's choose a free prep course to take together.
I have briefly looked at Kenzie.free. What prep course have you started on? Let's find our consistency. 
How far are you with the Grasshopper app?
So those are my thoughts thus far.
